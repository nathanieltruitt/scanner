# scanner
This is my attempt to build a network scan utility that I might actually use. Nmap is annoying to install and overkill when all you need is to see what ports are exposed.

Note I did not use Cobra for this project as I purposely want to keep the size of the program down to the standard library for the most part. Flags isn't the best argument parser out there but it does the job for me on a smaller project like this one.
